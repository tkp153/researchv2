CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlaser_proc.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "laser_proc", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "laser_proc" with
  any of the following names:

    laser_procConfig.cmake
    laser_proc-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "laser_proc" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "laser_proc_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "laser_proc" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
